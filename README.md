# News_Summarization_llm
fine-tuned a BART-based transformer model for abstractive text summarization. Using the HuggingFace ecosystem and the ILSUM dataset, a complete training and evaluation pipeline was built in PyTorch. The final model is capable of generating coherent, high-quality summaries from long-form news articles and achieved a ROUGE-1 score of over 37.
